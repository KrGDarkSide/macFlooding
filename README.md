# Mac Flooding

What is the mac flooding?
> An attack that involves sending a large number of Ethernet frames with fake source MAC addresses to a switch, in order to overflow its CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table. Once full, the switch broadcasts unknown unicast traffic to all ports, allowing the attacker to potentially intercept traffic not originally intended for them.
